To launch the ruby debugger, use "require 'debug'".  For example:

    def my_func
      x = 4
      require 'debug'   # debugger will launch in the console
      x = 2
    end

Do not use class instance variables in minitest 'before' blocks as they become visible to
all 'before' blocks and therefore can cause cross-test contamination.  For example:

  describe 'a' do
    before do
      @something = 42
    end
    it 'does a' do
      # etc.
    end
  end
  
  describe 'b' do
    before do
      $stderr.puts @something   # oops: this prints 42
    end
    it 'does b' do
      # etc.
    end
  end


To run just one test file, use something like:

  ruby -I"lib:test" test/controllers/sessions_controller_test.rb

Recreating the test db:

  $ RAILS_ENV=test bin/rake db:migrate


Associations are instances of ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy.  This method allows
one to write things like parent.children.new(params) and parent.children.destroy(child):

Example of invoking json via curl (here we update the title of the user with id 1):

    curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PATCH -d '{"user":{"title":"new title"}}' http://localhost:3000/users/1.json

Note that for this to work you have to change this line in application_controller.rb:

    protect_from_forgery with: :exception

to this:

    protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
