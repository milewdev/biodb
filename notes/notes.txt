To launch the ruby debugger, use "require 'debug'".  For example:

    def my_func
      x = 4
      require 'debug'   # debugger will launch in the console
      x = 2
    end

Do not use class instance variables in minitest 'before' blocks as they become visible to
all 'before' blocks and therefore can cause cross-test contamination.  For example:

  describe 'a' do
    before do
      @something = 42
    end
    it 'does a' do
      # etc.
    end
  end
  
  describe 'b' do
    before do
      $stderr.puts @something   # oops: this prints 42
    end
    it 'does b' do
      # etc.
    end
  end

To run just one test file, use something like:

  ruby -I"lib:test" test/controllers/sessions_controller_test.rb
