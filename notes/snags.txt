Menu items were not aligning properly on the main menu.

STATUS: fixed, 3 hours.  Ultimately had to explicity set the height of the li items,
and then set their line-height to the same value.

minitest appears as a production dependency on gemnasium when it is 
in 'group: :test' in the Gemfile.

Tests pass on development machine (seed 44926) but sometimes fail on Travis CI:

  1) Error:
HomePageTest::a user's title::when the user types something#test_0001_changes the title:
Capybara::Poltergeist::TimeoutError: Timed out waiting for response to {"name":"click","args":[56,5]}. It's possible that this happened because something took a very long time (for example a page load was slow). If so, setting the Poltergeist :timeout option to a higher value will help (see the docs for details). If increasing the timeout does not help, this is probably a bug in Poltergeist - please report it to the issue tracker.

Very low coverage numbers reported by coveralls.io.  Installed SimpleCov and 
discovered the same problem when building on development machine.  Solved by
removing :require => false from Gemfile, i.e. changed:

  gem 'coveralls', :require => false, group: :test

to:

  gem 'coveralls', group: :test

STATUS: fixed, 1 hour.  Need to investigate what :require => false does.

minitest + focus does not run tests that have enclosing describe blocks with 
parentheses - ( and ) - in their descriptions.  Removed parentheses from one
of the describe descriptions.

STATUS: fixed, 0.5 hours.  Need to check for parentheses in other tests,
need to write a _lint script to do this automatically, need to see if there
are other characters that also cause the issue, need to perhaps fix focus
and/or minitest.  Suspect issue is due to the fact that 'focus' simply
causes minitest to be run with the focused test's name as an argument, and
the shell may be interpretting the parentheses, or focus may be escaping
the parentheses thereby changing the descriptive text and as a result 
causing it to no longer match the test in the source code.

Interacting tests found.

STATUS: fixed, 3 hours.  Could be that two processes, the test code and the
js code on the web page, were changing a record in the test db for a given
test but only the test code was within a transaction and therefore was being 
rolled back.

UPDATE: better fix, 1 day.  self.use_transactional_fixtures = false within
class class ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest in test_helper.rb to force rails
to re-populate the fixtures in the test db between tests.  Does result in 
slower tests unfortunately.
