- Combine 'start date' and 'end date' into 'when'
- Implement job add

- Highlight (e.g. yellow background) the currently edited row
- Implement undo/redo; persisted? what is the unit of undo? character level or field level?
- Do we need version control? i.e. what did you change last month?  How to decide where the version changes occur
