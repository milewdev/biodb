#### TODO

- Where + when entry screen:
  - One multi-line text box where you can enter one company + optional date range(s) per line:
    Acme Inc., 2007.10-2009.6
    Software Inc., 2009.7-2010.7, 2012.1-2014.8
  - Horizontal bar graph that lists companies on the y-axis and a date range on the x-axis
  - Possibly allow user to adjust bar graph directly, e.g. drag-and-drop to re-arrange bars, adjust their lengths, etc.
- Add role to company (e.g. developer, manager, head nurse, etc.)
- Add achievements / what you did (e.g. analyzed data, wrote requirements doc, wrote conversion program, etc.)
