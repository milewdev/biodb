Refactor email_format_validator_test.rb and password_format_validator_test.rb

Refactor email_format_validator.rb and password_format_validator.rb

Map db exceptions to model errors

Refactor fixtures: use better fixture names

Remove uneeded methods from HomeController (e.g. index)

Refactor sign_up_test.rb

Test what happens when the sign up page and the sign in page are loaded in a browser when a user is already signed in

Adjust site to be responsive to different screen dimensions

Decide where to handle the trimming of titles (and other fields?) and where to convert empty title to nil (unless this happens automagically)

Do not allow newlines (i.e. pressing enter/return) in titles (why?)

Add a short-cut key to switch between view and edit modes.

Remove title from sign up page.

Add version number to footer; increment version number with each release.

Add _lint:
  - check for parentheses - ( and ) - in describe texts; minitest will not run them if they have an 'it' block with a focus:
  
    describe "a description with (parentheses)" do
      focus
      it "will be ignored" do
        $stderr.puts 'this will not be run'
      end
    end
    
  - also check for \s (which should be \'s); what about other escaped characters?

Need to decide which field should get focus when entering edit mode.

Replace things like click_link 'home' with home.click

Trim spaces from fields in both js and ruby.

If in edit mode and one goes away and then comes back, should one still be in edit mode?  What about simply refreshing the page?  Or
clicking the link that takes you to the same page (currently the home link)?

Disable the save button while we wait for a save to the server; re-enable if save failed.

Investigate what :require => false does in Gemfiles (re: coverals and simplecov gems).

Refactor title_test.rb to be like name_test.rb

The edit mode label should change to the hover color when the mouse hovers over it.
