Pasting into title field in edit mode caused Safari to display an error and reload the page.

Refreshing the page in Safari turns off edit mode; doing the same in firefox does not.  Should likely remain in
edit mode after a page refresh.  But what about leaving the page to go somewhere else and coming back?  In that
case one should return to view mode.  But what about the back button?  Should it return to edit mode?
